"NE2001 for extra-galactic astronomy"

This package is designed to calculate interesting/useful statistics related to scintillation and variability.
The assumption is that the objects of interest are extragalactic and thus we only need consider the total electron column.
Thus models like NE2001 are too simplistic, and so we use HÎ± as a proxy for electron column.
